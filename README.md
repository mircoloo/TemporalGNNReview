# Temporal Graph Neural Networks Evaluation Framework

This project focused on designing and evaluating **Temporal Graph Neural Networks (TGNNs)** for time-dependent structured data, with a specific application to financial forecasting.

## ðŸŽ¯ Goal

This project aims to build a **modular and extensible framework** for:

- Constructing temporal graphs from time-series data through various methodologies.
- Training and validating various TGNN architectures.
- Comparing model performance across standardized tasks.

## ðŸ“˜ Context

TGNNs extend standard Graph Neural Networks to handle **temporal dynamics**â€”crucial for domains like stock prediction, traffic forecasting, or dynamic social networks. 
While multiple TGNN models exist, comparing them fairly is still challenging due to differences in:
- Input preprocessing
- Temporal encoding
- Lack of standardized evaluation protcols
